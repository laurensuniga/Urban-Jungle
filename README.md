# Urban Jungle
This app was created for those who, like me, have quite a few different house plants and find it a little difficult to keep track of each and every single one of their needs. Urban Jungle allows you to keep all of the specific needs of all of your leafy green friends in one convenient place.

# Next Steps
I would like to add an API so you the user can choose from and add a photo to accompany the plant they are adding to their personal plant list.
